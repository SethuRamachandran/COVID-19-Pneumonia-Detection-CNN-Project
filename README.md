# COVID-19-Pneumonia-Detection-CNN-Project

In this project, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The primary objective was to leverage deep learning techniques to accurately identify and distinguish between these conditions, providing a valuable tool for aiding medical diagnosis.

The dataset used for this project was the COVID-19 Radiography Database, which contains labeled chest X-ray images for normal cases, viral pneumonia cases, and COVID-19 cases. The images were preprocessed and augmented to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

Our CNN model was designed with multiple convolutional, max-pooling. We employed TensorFlow and Keras for model building, training, and evaluation. Real-time data augmentation techniques were applied to further improve the model's performance.

Throughout the training process, we monitored the model's accuracy and loss using matplotlib, making iterative adjustments to optimize the results. The final model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying the X-ray images into the three target categories.
